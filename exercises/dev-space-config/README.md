4. Specify the dev space name and select extensions:
- Name the dev space: __TechEdDA262_U<##>__
> In U<##>, where ## represents the unique number assigned to you at the start of the exercise (for example, 01).
- What kind of application you want to create: 
    - Select __Full Stack Application Using Productivity Tools__
- _Select_ 4 SAP HANA extensions
  - __SAP HANA Calculation View Editor__
  - __SAP HANA Database explorer__ (added by default)
  - __SAP HANA tools__
  - __SAP HANA Performance tools__
- _Apply by clicking __Create Dev Space__

5. You will see that the newly created dev space is __starting__, once it is ready, that is indicated as __RUNNING__.  
Now you can go back to the SAP Build Code Lobby and create a Full-Stack Application project in the next excercise.
